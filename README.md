# TASK 6: Prediction using decision tree algorithm

This is my sixth task during my intership in Data Science & Business Analytics at The Sparks Foundation where the problem statement is to create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.<br>
OBJECTIVE: If we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.<br>
In this task, I have used R with rpart library to create decision tree classifier.<br>
